## oh-my-zsh setup and custom theme

just a few custom files and a simple theme hacked together from several others. 

* `/.oh-my-zsh/custom/shortcuts.zsh`
* `/.oh-my-zsh/custom/functions.zsh`
* `/.oh-my-zsh/themes/rdm.zsh-theme` *(thanks to eastwood and fino)*
* `/.oh-my-zsh/themes/rdm2.zsh-theme` *(lots of googling to get here but borrowed the concept from [jeremyFreeAgent - powerline omz theme](https://github.com/jeremyFreeAgent/oh-my-zsh-powerline-theme))*

I'm using iterm 2 with the [KitKat color scheme](https://github.com/zdj/themes) with Inconsolata for Powerline for both Regular and Non-ASCII


#####TODO:

1. better rvm integration
2. clean up
